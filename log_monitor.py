    Units for measurements:
        PM1, PM2.5, PM4 and PM10 are in ug/m^3, numerical concentrations are in #/cm^3

    20240209 Matthias Prinke    Created from log_1_sec.py for passive monitoring of the
                                SPS30 TX output in a
                                Bresser Air Quality PM2.5/PM10 Sensor (PN 7009970).
                                The aim is to find the actual sensor data in the payload
                                of the 868 MHz FSK radio message.
